# Language-Recognition Using ConvNets
_Written by Joscha S. Rieber (Fraunhofer IAIS) in 2020_

This project shows how to train a language-recognizer from scratch that is able to distinguish between German and English. These notebooks build up a playground together with the data from Common Voice to build strong models.

## Getting Started
* On Linux:
  * Download this repository from GitHub
  * Call "bash run.sh"
    * This script will first look if the environment is ready, if not, it will download Miniconda and create the conda environment. Please note that you will need "wget" to succeed.
  * Now go through the notebooks in the right order and follow the given instructions.
  
## Requirements
See requirements.txt for full list of pip requirements.
